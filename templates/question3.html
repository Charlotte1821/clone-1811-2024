        <h2>How do cloud services support the scalability of AI projects when handling high volumes of real-time data?</h2>
        <p>Cloud services support scalability by enabling automatic resource scaling and load balancing to handle data volume fluctuations, ensuring continuity and efficiency in data processing. They offer real-time data streaming tools like Apache Kafka and AWS Kinesis, ensuring timely data ingestion and processing to meet performance demands during data surges in AI projects. These services also provide distributed computing frameworks that help process large datasets in parallel, reducing latency and enhancing real-time decision-making.</p>
