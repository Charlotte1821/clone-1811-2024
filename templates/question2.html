        <h2>Why are web applications essential for providing user-friendly interfaces to deploy and interact with AI models?</h2>
        <p>Web applications are crucial for delivering user-friendly interfaces to interact with AI models because they encapsulate complex technical operations behind a simple and intuitive interface. This allows users to quickly utilize AI functionalities—whether for data analysis, image recognition, or natural language processing—without needing in-depth knowledge of the underlying algorithms or code. This ease of use significantly enhances the accessibility and practicality of AI technologies, enabling more people to benefit from the convenience that AI offers.</p>
