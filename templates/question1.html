        <h2>How do cloud platforms enable the storage and processing of large datasets required for real-world AI projects?</h2>
        <p>Cloud platforms enable the storage and processing of large datasets by providing scalable storage and computing resources, which are essential for real-world Artificial Intelligence (AI) projects. For instance, if a significant processing capacity is required during a specific period, cloud platforms can quickly scale up to meet these demands—Scalability. Cloud solutions can be accessed from virtually anywhere with an internet connection, encouraging collaboration among geographically dispersed team members—Accessibility. Additionally, cloud platforms offer object storage solutions like Amazon S3, which are ideal for storing vast amounts of unstructured and semi-structured data—Data Storage. By providing the necessary infrastructure and tools, cloud platforms empower AI projects to store, process, and analyze large datasets, driving advancements in real-world AI applications.</p>
