        <h2>How do cloud services support scalability and ensure real-time data ingestion?</h2>
        <p>Cloud services support scalability and ensure real-time data ingestion by providing elastic computing resources that can automatically adjust to varying workloads. They utilize tools like Apache Kafka, AWS Kinesis, and Google Pub/Sub to process and stream real-time data with minimal latency. Additionally, these services integrate data pipelines that allow for seamless ingestion, transformation, and storage of data. By offering these capabilities, cloud platforms enable organizations to maintain high-performance systems that can handle spikes in data volume while ensuring data is processed in real time.</p>
